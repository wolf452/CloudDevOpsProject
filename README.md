# Multi-Cloud DevOps Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive multi-cloud DevOps architecture that integrates cloud services with DevOps tools to manage and deploy infrastructure and applications across multiple cloud platforms.

---

## Architecture

### 1. **Infrastructure Setup**  
   - Use **Terraform** to provision cloud infrastructure across AWS, Azure, and GCP.  
   - Configure resources using **Ansible**.

### 2. **CI/CD Pipeline**  
   - Leverage **Jenkins** for a seamless pipeline to manage infrastructure and application deployment.  
   - Perform code quality checks and security analysis using **SonarQube** backed by **PostgreSQL**.

### 3. **Application Management**  
   - Utilize **Docker** and **Kubernetes** for containerized application management.  
   - Support deployment on multiple cloud environments.

## Key Components

1. **Terraform**  
   - Automates provisioning of resources such as networks, databases, and virtual machines across multiple clouds.

2. **Ansible**  
   - Configures environments and deploys applications.  
   - Includes roles to install tools like Docker, Jenkins, Java, and more.

3. **Jenkins**  
   - Manages pipelines for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).

4. **SonarQube**  
   - Ensures code quality and performs static analysis for security.

5. **Docker and Kubernetes**  
   - Manages containerized applications and deploys them across cloud platforms.

## Workflow

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Install required tools (Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, etc.).  
   - Configure cloud credentials (AWS, Azure, GCP).

2. **Terraform Execution:**
   - Provision the necessary cloud resources using the following commands:  
     ```bash
     terraform init
     terraform plan
     terraform apply
     ```

3. **Ansible Execution:**
   - Configure servers and deploy applications using Ansible playbooks:  
     ```bash
     ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
     ```

4. **Jenkins Pipeline:**
   - Manage and automate all processes in a CI/CD environment.
